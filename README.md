# 🧠 Enterprise RFP Response Automation Platform

An **AI-assisted multi-agent system** that automates enterprise **RFP (Request for Proposal) analysis**, **requirement extraction**, **product matching**, **pricing generation**, and **final response drafting** — all through an interactive **Streamlit web interface**.

This platform is designed for **B2B enterprises** handling complex RFPs from organizations such as manufacturing, finance, and large-scale operations.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Automated RFP Analysis**
  Extracts technical, commercial, and compliance requirements from RFP documents or raw text.

* **Multi-Agent Architecture**
  Modular agents handle discovery, analysis, matching, pricing, and orchestration independently.

* **Product Matching Engine**
  Maps RFP requirements to an internal product/SKU catalog with confidence scoring.

* **Pricing & Commercial Optimization**
  Generates INR-based pricing, discounts, and competitive positioning.

* **Confidence Scoring**
  Quantifies response readiness based on coverage, gaps, and compliance.

* **Enterprise-Grade UI**
  Clean, professional Streamlit interface suitable for demos, evaluations, and stakeholders.

* **Offline / Cost-Free AI Design**
  No paid APIs required — designed for local or private enterprise deployments.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

The platform follows a **multi-agent orchestration model**:

1. **Chief Orchestrator**
   Coordinates the complete workflow and manages state.

2. **Discovery Agent**
   Understands RFP context and scope.

3. **Document Analysis Agent**
   Extracts and categorizes requirements (technical, compliance, commercial).

4. **Product Matching Agent**
   Matches requirements against the product catalog and identifies gaps.

5. **Pricing Agent**
   Generates line-item pricing, discounts, and totals in INR.

6. **Response Compiler**
   Produces a structured, submission-ready RFP response.

* Identified gaps
* Compliance fulfillment

This helps teams decide whether the response is:

* Ready for submission
* Needs review
* Requires escalation

---
